    "\n",
    "*   System dynamics are good when you want a big picture overview of how a time-dependent system behaves, but you don't necessary understand or know the underlying microscopic processes. Can also be used in combination with more sophisticated simulations that **do** include microscopic mechanisms. Provides a reasonable way to interpret what is going on or to get a feel for how a microscopic model should behave in certain limiting cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Cellular automata and their popular cousin agent-based modeling provides a way to model microscopic mechanisms. In some cases, the microscopic mechanisms can give way to macroscopic behavior that you observe in simpler models. Other times, there are simulation regimes that behave in new and expected ways.\n",

    "*   Rule-based simulations composed of many individual actors or particles can give rise to emergent phenomena, whereby new collective behaviors that are not \"allowed\" in the individual rules start to come about.\n",
