# List comprehensions

Assume we have a list within a list:

```{python}
mylist_2d = [[0, 2], [2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8]]
```

List comprehensions make it simple to extract the values within the first and second *columns*:

```{python}
mylist_col_one = [value[0] for value in mylist_2d]
mylist_col_two = [value[1] for value in mylist_2d]
print("Column 1: {0}\nColumn 2: {1}".format(mylist_col_one,
                                            mylist_col_two))
```

---

# List comprehensions

Alternative would be to use a `for` loop:

```{python}
mylist_col_one = []
mylist_col_two = []
for value in mylist_2d:
    mylist_col_one.append(value[0])
    mylist_col_two.append(value[1])

print("Column 1: {0}\nColumn 2: {1}".format(mylist_col_one,
                                            mylist_col_two))
```

# Boolean logic: Comparisons

.pull-left[
| Operation | Meaning                  |
| ------    | ------------------------ |
| <	        | strictly less than       |
| <=        | less than or equal       |
| >         | strictly greater than    |
| >=        | greater than or equal    |
| ==        | equal                    |
| !=        | not equal                |
| is        | object identity          |
| is not    | negated object identity  |
]

.pull-right.code80[
```{python}
print(1 < 2,
      True == False,
      True is False,
      sep = "\n")
```

```{python}
x = None
print(x == None,  #  not "Pythonic"
      x is None,  # "Pythonic"
      sep = "\n")
```

# Boolean logic: Operators and chaining

.pull-left[
**Operators:** .mono[and], .mono[or], .mono[not]

| Operation      | Result                                                |
| ------         | ----------                                            |
| .mono[x or y]  | if x is false, then y, else x                         |
| .mono[x and y] | if x is false, then x, else y                         |
| .mono[not x]   | if x is false, then .mono[True],<br>else .mono[False] |

**Chaining**

* Two ways to write mathematical statements like $a \leq b < c$.
* More complex statements should be enclosed in parentheses and connected with operators

.pull-left[
```{python}
a, b, c = (3, 4, 5)
print(a <= b < c,
      (a <= b) and (b < c),
      sep = "\n")

# Whitespace in Python

* How Python uses whitespace

* When it's mandatory

* When it's optional, but recommended

# User-defined functions

# Functions: What are they?

* You've used them already, you just haven't made your own.

* Why bother? 

* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and building with legos

* Ideal use case: small re-usable pieces that do one thing.

* Basic idea: You have a set of instructions that take inputs and steps through the instructions. You may or may not get an output, depending on what you want to do.

* Every modern language uses them, even Matlab!

  ```matlab
  % Example of a function definition in Matlab

  function m = avg(x,n)
  m = sum(x)/n;
  end
  ```

    """

    # procedural Python program.

        a = input1 + input2
