# Arithmetic

Basic arithmetic is easy to do in Python

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

* Raising to a power

* Order of operations

```{python arithmetic-demo}
print(3 * (5 / 8 - 1.25) ** 2)
```

The `print()` function is the easiest way to tell Python to show output.

---

# Variable assignment

Just like in algebra or in other programming languages, we can use variable assignment to store values for future use.

```{python}
length_of_bridge = 15
```

To see what's in the variable, we can print it:

```{python}
print(length_of_bridge)
```

You can increment variables easily in Python:

```{python}
# What do you think the result will be?
length_of_bridge += 2 * length_of_bridge
```

--

```{python}
print(length_of_bridge)
```

# Arithmetic with mathematical functions

Python has built-in support for mathematical functions like sines, cosines, exponentials, factorials, etc. However, you need to load them in first.

```{python import-math-module}
import math
```

After running this, the mathematical functions can be accessed by appending a period `.` to the end of the word `math`, and then typing out the correct function name.

```{python}
print(math.factorial(12))         # Evaluates 12!
print(5 * math.sin(math.pi / 3))  # Evaluates 5sin(ùúã/3)
```

---

# Loading external .py files

The import statement can also be used to load `.py` files. Say you have a file named `my_program.py` **in the same directory as the file or Jupyter notebook you're currently editing.** To load the code from `my_program.py`, used

```python
import my_program
```

This will cause the code inside `my_program.py` to be executed once. If any functions were defined in this file, for example a function named `my_great_method()`, you can access it in the same way you use the `math` module:

```python
my_program.my_great_method()
```

# The Python Standard Library

`math` is not the only built-in module available in Python. A full list of all available modules along with their documentation are available online: <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/>

Examples of modules I use a lot are:

* .mono[`re`]: Support for regular expressions
* .mono[`collections`]: Specialized container data types for Python
* .mono[`itertools`]: Functions creating iterators for efficient looping
* .mono[`functools`]: Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects
* .mono[`pathlib`]: Object-oriented filesystem paths
* .mono[`shutil`]: High-level file operations
* .mono[`os`]: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces
* .mono[`logging`]: Logging facility for Python
* .mono[`subprocess`]: Subprocess management
* .mono[`sys`]: System-specific parameters and functions

and more!

# Data structures

---

# Using lists

* What is a list?

* Lists are not vectors.

* Anything can go into a list.

* How to access and slice elements in a list.

* Nesting lists

* Appending to lists

* Joining lists

---

# Dictionaries

* What is a Python dictionary?

* Key-value pairs

* Nearly anything can be a key or a value

* Lists can go in dictionaries

* Nested dictionaries

* Viewing keys and values

* Accessing with brackets versus `.get()`

---

# Other structures

* Tuples

* Sets

---
