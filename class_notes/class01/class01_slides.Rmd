# JupyterLab: things to discuss

.code90.font90[
* What is JupyterLab?
* Install plugins
  * Install the `git` plugin:
    ```sh
    jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/git
    ```
  * Install the GitHub plugin:
    ```sh
    jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/github
    ```
* **Launching JupyterLab**

  Open up a command prompt, activate the `cds411` conda environment, and run
  ```sh
  jupyter lab
  ```
  By default, your web browser may launch and show you an interface. If it doesn't, open your browser and type `localhost:8888` in the address bar and press enter.

> What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

.quote-container[
> Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
