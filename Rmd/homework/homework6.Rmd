title: Homework 6
---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
source("../../R/rmarkdown_setup.R")
```

## Instructions

Obtain the GitHub repository you will use to complete the homework assignment, which contains the starter Jupyter notebook file `homework6.ipynb`.
The notebook template provides space for you to answer each question.
Your notebook should run without error when you select **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells**:

```{r, out.width = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/jupyterlab_restart_kernel_and_run_all.png")
```

When youâ€™re done, save your file, then stage, commit, and push (upload) it to GitHub, and then follow the instructions in the [How to submit](#how-to-submit) section.

## Questions

@.  Starting from the random walk code in the class 22 Jupyter notebook in the `course_materials` repo on Github, <https://github.com/jkglasbrenner/cds411-course-materials/blob/master/class_notes/class22/class22_notebook.ipynb>, revise the code so that the random walker can take steps along the north, east, south, or west directions with probabilities of 20%, 30%, 45%, or 5%, respectively.
    You may do this using either the pseudocode-based version of the code or the `numpy` version of the code.

    **Hint:** You're not just changing probabilities, you also have to change the step directions from northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest to north, east, south, and west.

@.  Starting from the random walk code in the class 22 Jupyter notebook in the `course_materials` repo on Github, <https://github.com/jkglasbrenner/cds411-course-materials/blob/master/class_notes/class22/class22_notebook.ipynb>, develop a function that:

    1.  Uses the distance formula to compute the distance traveled during a single random walk of `nsteps`.
    
    2.  Computes the average distance traveled for any given value of `nsteps` by running the random walk simulation 1000 times, computing the distance traveled during each run, and then averaging the results.
    
    3.  Using the above routine, computes the average distances covered for random walks of step sizes from 1 to 50 (you will end up with 50 data points).
    
    4.  Plots the average distance traveled as a function of `nsteps`, reproducing Figure 9.5.3 in the textbook.
    
    You may do this using either the pseudocode-based version of the code or the `numpy` version of the code.

## How to submit

**To lock in your submission time**, export your notebook to PDF and upload the PDF file to the assignment posting on Blackboard.

```{r jupyterlab-export-to-pdf, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/jupyterlab_export_to_pdf.png")
```

**In addition, be sure to save, commit, and push your final result so that everything is synchronized to GitHub.**
I may want to inspect your source files directly and run your notebook, so it's very important that the files in your homework repository match what I see in the PDF export uploaded to Blackboard.
