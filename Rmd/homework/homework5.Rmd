```{r setup, include = FALSE}
source("../../R/rmarkdown_setup.R")
```

## Instructions

Obtain the GitHub repository you will use to complete the homework assignment, which contains the starter Jupyter notebook file `homework5.ipynb`.
The notebook template provides space for you to answer each question.
Your notebook should run without error when you select **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells**:

```{r, out.width = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/jupyterlab_restart_kernel_and_run_all.png")
```

When youâ€™re done, save your file, then stage, commit, and push (upload) it to GitHub, and then follow the instructions in the [How to submit](#how-to-submit) section.

## Questions

### Monte Carlo integration

For questions @pi-estimate and @sphere-volume, do the following:

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>

**a.**  Starting with the Monte Carlo functions demoed in the class 21 notes, <https://github.com/jkglasbrenner/cds411-course-materials/blob/master/class_notes/class21>, modify the function so that it can compute the value of the requested quantity. You should be able to specify the number of darts used in the computation.

**b.** Run the function defined in Part a 10,000 times, computing the mean of the results.

**c.** Use resampling to compute the standard error of the mean. Review the code under the **Activity** header in the class 21 notes for a refresher.

**d.** Visualize the distribution of values obtained in Part b. Your figure should also plot a line representing the mean value and the upper and lower bounds for the standard error of the mean.

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

@pi-estimate.
    An estimate of $\pi$.
    The area of a circle is $\pi r^{2}$, where $r$ is the radius.
    The equation of a circle of radius $r$ with center at the origin is $x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$.
    Use a circle of radius 1.
    Consider the quarter of the circle in the first quadrant with $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and $0 \leq y \leq 1$, and multiply your result by 4.
    
@sphere-volume.
    An estimate of the volume of a sphere of radius 1 whose equation is $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\leq{}1$.
    Consider the portion of the sphere with $x \geq 0$, $y \geq 0$, and $z \geq 0$; and multiply your result by 8.
    In the case of three dimensions, a point has three coordinates $(x, y, z)$.
    Notice that Monte Carlo integration is useful for dimensions beyond two.
    
### Random number sampling

For question @rejection-sampling, use the methods discussed in the chapter 9.3 of the textbook chapter and in the [class 21][class-21-notes] and [class 22][class-22-notes] lecture notes.

@rejection-sampling.
    This question develops code for the rejection method with the probability density function $f(x)=2\pi\sin(4\pi x)$.

    1.  Define a Python function to represent the formula $f(x)=2\pi\sin(4\pi x)$. For an example, see `cubic_function` defined in the `mc_integration.py` file: <https://github.com/jkglasbrenner/cds411-course-materials/blob/master/class_notes/class21/mc_integration.py>

    2.  Plot $f(x)$ from 0.0 to 2.5, see Figure 9.3.12 in the textbook.

    3.  Assign to variable `rand` a uniform number from 0.0 to 0.25, the interval of interest in Figure 9.3.12.

    4.  Define a Python function called `rejection_method()` with no arguments that will return a random number using the rejection method.
        The algorithm for the rejection method is as follows:

        *   If $f(\texttt{rand})$ is greater than a uniform random number from 0 to $2\pi\sin(4\pi/8)=2\pi\sin(\pi/2)=2\pi$, which is the maximum value of $f(x)$, return `rand`.

        *   If the condition is false, we reject `rand` and search for another candidate.

        Implement this algorithm using a `while` loop in Python, such that you exit the loop only after a candidate that passes the test is found.

    5.  Use the function you built in the previous step to generate a list of 1000 random numbers from 0.0 to 0.25 sampled from the probability density function $f(x)=2\pi\sin(4\pi x)$ using the rejection method.

    6.  Display a histogram of these values.


## How to submit

**To lock in your submission time**, export your notebook to PDF and upload the PDF file to the assignment posting on Blackboard.

```{r jupyterlab-export-to-pdf, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/jupyterlab_export_to_pdf.png")
```

**In addition, be sure to save, commit, and push your final result so that everything is synchronized to GitHub.**
I may want to inspect your source files directly and run your notebook, so it's very important that the files in your homework repository match what I see in the PDF export uploaded to Blackboard.
